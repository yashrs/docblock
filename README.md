# Problem Statement

People do not have access to Medical Records on the Go!

Assume that you are out for a holiday with your Family. You have just reached the holiday destination and you discover that you are having a head ache. Soon, you observe symptoms of Fever and eventually collapse because of that. Now, your Dad takes you to the nearest hospital and doctors recommend that you should be admitted immediately. 

At this time, it is very well possible that the disease you have caught is serious and could lead to serious problems. Doctors want to provide you medication as soon as possible, but based on the explanation of the situation given by your family members, it is very difficult for them to pin point your exact problem. This is where our service comes into picture. You, have all of your Medical records stored in the blockchain. 

You can authorise doctors to view your records and based on that, doctors can use our service and get all your Medical records which includes your entire medical history from your blood group to Allergies. The Proposed System also includes accessibility of partner equivalent privileges, which means that if for some reason, you are not able to authorise a doctor to access your records, then on your behalf your partner or any family member can allow Doctors to access your medical records. 

If you have had any such symptoms in past and experiencing the same thing again now, doctors can immediately get access to all those records.
